Name: Babatunde Ishau
Track: Frontend Wizard
Stage: 1
Program: HNG 13 Internship

🧱 Project Description

This is a responsive and accessible multi-page portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript, fulfilling all HNG 13 Stage 1 specifications.

The project includes:

A clean Homepage, About, and Contact page with consistent navigation.

A real-time timestamp rendered using Date.now() and displayed via data-testid="test-user-time".

A contact form with validation and a success message (no backend submission required).

Proper semantic HTML5 structure and accessibility compliance.

Use of data-testid attributes for automated testing and HNG validation.

⚙️ Key Features

Dynamic Time Display: Updates every second using JavaScript.

Form Validation: Ensures all fields are correctly filled before displaying a success message.

Reusable Layout: Uniform header, footer, and navigation across all pages.

Clean UI: Optimized for readability, spacing, and modern design principles.

Accessibility: ARIA labels, clear structure, and user-friendly tab order.

🧩 Technologies Used

HTML5

CSS3 (Responsive Design & Layout Structure)

Vanilla JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Validation Logic)

🧠 How It Works

Users can navigate between Home, About, and Contact pages via the navbar.

The real-time clock updates dynamically every second.

When users fill and submit the contact form:

JavaScript validates all fields (name, email, subject, and message).

If valid, a success message appears:

“Thank you! Your message has been successfully submitted.”

The form resets automatically afterward.

🧪 Test Attributes

All critical elements contain data-testid attributes as required for automated testing by HNG:

test-user-time

test-contact-form

test-contact-name, test-contact-email, test-contact-subject, test-contact-message

test-contact-error-* and test-contact-success

🌐 Deployment

Hosted live on GitHub Pages and Netlify for easy accessibility and testing.

💡 Developer’s Note

This task demonstrates strong attention to detail, clean coding standards, and practical frontend problem-solving — a solid step toward more advanced HNG challenges ahead.
